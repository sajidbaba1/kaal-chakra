# Kaal Chakra: The 13-Month Calendar

**Kaal Chakra** (Sanskrit: काल चक्र, "Wheel of Time") is an interactive web application that provides a unique window into the **International Fixed Calendar**, a proposed 13-month calendar system. This project aims to explore how different structures of time can alter our perception and organization of life, all wrapped in a design inspired by ancient Indian aesthetics.

It serves as a functional calendar, a historical learning tool, and a demonstration of modern web technologies.

## Core Features

- **13-Month Calendar View**: A fully interactive calendar displaying a year with 13 months of exactly 28 days each.
- **Dynamic Date Highlighting**: The current date is always highlighted, providing an immediate anchor in this alternative time system.
- **Special Day Indicators**: Clearly marks the unique "Year Day" and "Leap Day" that exist outside of any month or week.
- **Historical Context**: A dedicated page, presented in Hindi, that delves into the history of the 13-month calendar and the reasons it was never widely adopted.
- **Ancient-Inspired UI**: A carefully selected color palette and typography create a dark, high-contrast "woody" design that evokes a sense of history and mystique.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully accessible and usable across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
